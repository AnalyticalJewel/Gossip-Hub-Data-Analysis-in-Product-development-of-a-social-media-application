About Me:
Hello! I'm Jewel Alam, and I have a wide academic background, including a bachelor's and master's degree in pharmacy. However, my passion is in the field of data analysis. This interest encouraged me to make a bold decision in my last year. I skipped the campus placement session to delve more into the topic of data analytics. 

I started my journey by watching free lectures on YouTube, where I gained a basic understanding of data analytics. Eager to broaden my expertise, I enrolled in several lengthy bootcamps on Udemy, focused on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. The courses equipped me with the knowledge and confidence required to take on real-world projects. 

Over time, I've completed a few projects using tools and technologies such as Python (with a particular focus on the Pandas library), MySQL, Tableau, Statistics and Excel. Every project has served as an opportunity for me to develop my skill set and gain a better understanding of data analytics. 

My long-term objective is strong and clear: to become one of the world's top data analysts. I'm primarily interested in analysis for app development, web development, and software product development. These sectors not only match my skills, but also excite me because of their potential to innovate and revolutionize industry. 

Thank you for taking the time to discover more about me. I am excited to bring my experience and passion for data analytics to relevant and impactful projects.  

 Warm Regards 

 Jewel Alam 


Introduction: 

In today's digital era, social media platforms have become a vital part of millions of people's everyday lives, particularly among young people. As an Analyst, my responsibility is to use data to drive better decisions and strategic efforts in the creation of creative products. This project focuses on the creation of "Gossip Hub" a cutting-edge social media program that is particularly meant to engage and connect young people. 

This project will apply advanced analytical tools such as Python's Pandas, SQL, and Tableau to study and comprehend user behaviors, preferences, and trends in the social media environment. Using these technologies, we will do extensive data analysis to find important insights that will guide the design, features, and functioning of Gossip Hub. Our objective is to establish a platform that not only meets, but surpasses, the expectations of youthful users, while also cultivating a lively and participatory community. 
 
The conclusions acquired from this study will help the development team make data-driven decisions, ensuring that Gossip Hub connects with its target audience and distinguishes out in a competitive market.
